## System Design

- {LLD} - is a component-level design process that follows a step-by-step refinement process. This process can be used for designing data structures, required software architecture, source code and ultimately, performance algorithms.
- 
- {HLD} - Commonly abbreviated as HLD, the high level design is a general system of design. In simpler words, it refers to the overall design of a system and describes the overall architecture/ description of any application. It is also called system/ macro-level design.
- 
- {SOLID principles} -  SOLID is an acronym that stands for five key design principles: single responsibility principle, open-closed principle, Liskov substitution principle, interface segregation principle, and dependency inversion principle. All five are commonly used by software engineers and provide some important benefits for developers.
