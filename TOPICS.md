## System Design

- LLD (Low Level Design) - is a component-level design process that follows a step-by-step refinement process. This process can be used for designing data structures, required software architecture, source code and ultimately, performance algorithms.

Function of LLD : The treatment for functional LLD typically involves physical therapy, massage, and specific exercises to correct areas of imbalance and weakness. It is also important to correct poor posture. The exact type and number of interventions that a person needs will depend on the underlying cause and severity of the LLD.

Examples of  LLD :- Design Parking Lot , Design Splitwise , Design Tik Tok Toe Game . Design Car Rental System , Design Bookmyshow , Design Pub Sub System , Design Coffee Vending Machine.

- HLD (High Level Design) - Commonly abbreviated as HLD, the high level design is a general system of design. In simpler words, it refers to the overall design of a system and describes the overall architecture/ description of any application. It is also called system/ macro-level design.

Function of HLD : High-level design (HLD) explains the architecture that would be used to develop a system. The architecture diagram provides an overview of an entire system, identifying the main components that would be developed for the product and their interfaces.

Examples of HLD :- Mobile clients for upload from phone and search for media assets , Desktop client for bulk import/export of both media and related information , Web application for searching among media assets , Web application for user management, i.e. party domain.


- SOLID principles -  SOLID is an acronym that stands for five key design principles: single responsibility principle, open-closed principle, Liskov substitution principle, interface segregation principle, and dependency inversion principle. All five are commonly used by software engineers and provide some important benefits for developers.

purpose of SOLID principles : The goal of the SOLID principles is to reduce dependencies so that we can change one area of software without impacting others. Additionally, they're intended to make designs easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

Examples of SOLID principles :-  Single Responsibility , Open/Closed , Liskov Substitution , Interface Segregation , Dependency Inversion.

- SDLC (systems development life cycle )  - Software Development Life Cycle defines the complete cycle of development i.e. all the tasks involved in planning, creating, testing, and deploying a Software Product. SDLC is a process that defines the various stages involved in the development of software for delivering a high-quality product.

function of SDLC : The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that enables the production of high-quality, low-cost software, in the shortest possible production time. The goal of the SDLC is to produce superior software that meets and exceeds all customer expectations and demands.

Examples of SDLC :- the development costs decreased , new features could be added , cloud support was visible , among others. Related to the streaming services , the developers added features like movie renting features and SVOD in this SDLC Real Life .
